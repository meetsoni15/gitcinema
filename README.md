## What is gitcinema?

`gitcinema` turns any git repository's history into an interactive terminal experience. Every commit is a **frame**. Press `Space` to play and watch your codebase evolve — files appear, grow, and disappear as your team's work unfolds chronologically.

- 🎬 **Play / Pause** — auto-advance through commits at configurable speed
- 📂 **Live file tree** — see exactly which files changed, added, or deleted in each frame
- 🎭 **Author characters** — every contributor gets a unique color + symbol (`●◆▲■★`)
- 🔍 **Search** — fuzzy search through commit messages with `/`
- 🎛️ **Filter** — show only one author's commits with `f`
- 🌿 **Branch-aware** — inspect any branch with `--branch`

## Features

### 🎬 Playback Controls
- `Space` to **play/pause** — commits advance automatically like a movie
- Adjustable speed: `0.25x → 0.5x → 1x → 2x → 4x` via `+` / `-`
- Auto-stops at the last commit

### 📂 File Tree Pane (Left)
Each commit shows which files changed, with colored prefixes:

| Symbol | Color | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `+` | 🟢 Green | File added |
| `~` | 🟡 Yellow | File modified |
| `-` | 🔴 Red | File deleted |
| `→` | 🔵 Cyan | File renamed |

Per-file `+N -N` line counts shown inline.

### 📝 Commit Detail Pane (Right)

- Absolute date + relative time (`2 hours ago`)
- Total insertions / deletions
- Full list of changed files with per-file stats

### 🎭 Author Legend
Every unique contributor appears in the top strip with their assigned color and symbol. Colors are deterministically assigned by the order authors first appear in history — consistent across runs.

### 🔍 Search (`/`)
Type to instantly filter commits by message, author, or hash. Press `Enter` to jump to the first result.

### 🎛️ Author Filter (`f`)
Type an author name to show only their commits. Press `Esc` to clear.
